# simulating-web-based-Vulnerabilities
This is the project based on simulating web-based vulnerabilities  which involves intentionally creating scenarios that mimic real-world security weaknesses in web applications. This process helps identify and address potential vulnerabilities before they can be exploited maliciously.
