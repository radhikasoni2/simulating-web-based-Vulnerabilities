            Simulating web-based vulnerabilities involves intentionally creating scenarios that mimic real-world security weaknesses in web applications. This process helps identify and address potential vulnerabilities before they can be exploited maliciously.

                Simulating web-based vulnerabilities involves creating scenarios to mimic common security flaws in web applications, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), or CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery). This process helps assess the resilience of web systems against potential cyber attacks, aiding in identifying and fixing vulnerabilities before they are exploited by malicious actors.
